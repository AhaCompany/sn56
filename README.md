## Recommended Compute Requirements

### Validator Requirements

A validator should be capable of running inference on multiple 8B models in parallel.

| Component    | Specification                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| VRAM        | 80GB                                  |
| Storage     | 500GB (minimum)<br>1TB (recommended)  |
| RAM         | 64GB+ (recommended)                   |
| Example GPUs| A100 (recommended)<br>H100 (overkill) |
| vCPUs       | 12 (minimum)<br>18+ (recommended)     |

### Miner Requirements

Requirements vary based on accepted jobs and LoRA training usage.
